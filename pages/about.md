I am a programming/computer enthusiast, right now working as Senior Analyst at Jaypee Capital, Delhi.

I received my Dual Degree(B.tech in Electrical Engineering & M.tech in Instrumentation and Signal processing) from [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) and earned my minor too ;) in Computer Science & Engineering.

I have two siblings, an elder sister Laxmi who works as junior engineer at Airport Authority of India and a younger brother Vinesh who is undergraduate student at Lucknow University.
