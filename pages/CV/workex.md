          <td class="right">Opera Solutions is Big Data company which based on USA. Right after my graduation, I started worling at Opera. Here I have developed a Merchant Matching Tool (MMT) for a client using Fuzzy String Matching and <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> text processing library written in Java. The desinged tool improved matching accuracy to 77% from 56%. I also automated the whole Extraction, Transport & Loading (ELT) process and  result generation process.<br></br><a href="http://www.operasolutions.com/" target="_blank">www.operasolutions.com</a>

          <td class="right">University of Queensland is a well known institute in the field of Robotics. I worked there at Robotics Design Lab under supervision on <a href="http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au/~hannakur/" target="_blank">Prof. Hanna Kurniawati</a>. During this preriod I was working on planning under uncertaninty using Partially Observable Markov Decision Process famously known as POMDP. We developed a new POMDP solver named SBT (State-sequence based Belief Tree) which can handle time varying POMDP models and can handle state-space large upto 1.9 Million states. Initial results showed that SBT is upto 120 time faster than existing fasted POMDP solver named POMCP.<br></br><a href="http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au/dokuwiki/" target="_blank">Robotics Lab</a>

          <td class="right">This was my first internship. I worked at Robotics Intelligece Lab under supervision of <a href="http://robinlab.uji.es/users/angel-p-del-pobil" target="_blank">Prof. Angel P del Pobil</a> and <a href="http://www.robotic-creatures.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Mario Prats</a>. During this time, I learned many things but Robot Operating System (<a href="http://www.ros.org" target="_blank">ROS</a>) was most prominant one. I developed a new pacakge im_joint_state_publisher which provides interface for controlling robot from a visualizer or simulator. I also, developed a pacakge to formalize and facilitate planning of interaction tasks for robots instead of using heuristics. On top of that, I also done some tweaks in 3D model of Tombatossals (humanoid torso) to facilitate its simulation in <a href="http://gazebosim.org/" target="_blank">Gazebo</a> (physics simulator)<br></br><a href="http://robinlab.uji.es/" target="_blank">Robotics Lab</a>
